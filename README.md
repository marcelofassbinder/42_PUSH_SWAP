# 42_PUSH_SWAP üîÑ
Sorting data on stacks.
# About ‚úç
Being the first Rank02 project of 42 Common Core, Push_swap is all about sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. 
The goal is to write a program in C which calculates and displays on the standard output the list of operations between two stacks that sorts the integers received as arguments.
For this I needed to choose for a sort algorithm that optimized the most this whole proccess, and the chosen one was the Turk Algorithm.
